# portfolio
 Hello, my name is Dawid and this is my portfolio website that I always wanted to create and implement new features as I'll learn some cool new stuff.

 You can check my code out and maybe tell me some tips and tricks to write better code.
 It is actually not the only one reason why I am posting it here, but for learning GitHub and Git as well.

 I am quite new in programmers world, but I am trying to code on my own without using copy/paste but only google and rewrite the code on my own.

 Have fun and stay healthy!
